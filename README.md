# Patient-Vitals-Monitoring
In this project, a patient vitals monitoring system integrated with various sensors has been developed. The purpose of this system is to enable patients to monitor and track their vital parameters like temperature and heart rate. This data is sent to the cloud as well as to the concerned doctor and the nearest relative of the patient can constantly track the patient. This system is useful for people who live away from their parents and also for soldiers who are based in remote locations where not many facilities are available.
